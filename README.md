# Variables & Constants

## Learning Objectives



* Explain the following piece of code correctly. We declared a new variable called favoriteCharacter and gave it a value of Jon Snow.
```Swift
var favoriteCharacter = "Jon Snow"
```

* Create a variable in a playground file.
* Change the value of a variable to another value (of the same type).
* Explain how a constant is used and why it differs from a variable. (let/var)
* Recognize the error produced when you attempt to change the value of a constant to something else.
* Explain why we have both options and how best we can make the choice between using a variable/constant.  

## What the Student Already Knows  
Nothing üññüèº - this will be the first reading.

## Outline / Notes

* Create a narrative around something that might be familiar to the student. In the bullet points below we use Game of Thrones to connect something they know to the abstract idea of variables. If you prefer to use a different analogy, definitely go for it. Always think about it in terms of story. You can do that with asking a question or presenting a problem around what the student already knows. Be funny! Be accessible! Use gifs (if you like).
* Instead of having to repetitively type "Jon Snow" over and over again in our application which represents our favorite Game of Thrones character, we can store this in a variable.
* How do we then create a variable? It would be helpful to the student if there was a playground file along with this readme where the student can see the code and code along to what it is you're doing.
* I like challenging the student a little here after you've shown them how to create a variable. In the playground file, have comments as follows:
```Swift
// Create another variable named favoriteLannister with the value "Tyrion Lannister"
// Create another variable named favoriteMovie with the value of your choosing (whichever your favorite movie is).
// Create another variable that represents your favorite color. What do you think the name of the variable should be?  
```  
  
* Below each comment, the student should type out the code. I want them to begin building a habit where they read the code presented to them AND then type it out in a playground file, not copy/pasting anything.
* Teaching them that they can indeed change the value of a variable if they want. Teach them in a way where you first phrase it as a question.. "What if we decide after a certain episode that "Jon Snow" is no longer our favorite Stark? Can we change our favoriteStark variable?
* Similiar to how we discuss variables above, take the same approach with constants. 
* Have the student see what it looks like when they try to change the value of a constant.
* Make them try to change the name of a constant in the playground file.
* Wrap up the difference between let and var
